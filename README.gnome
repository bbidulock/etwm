Notes about the GNOME-compliance patches to ETWM.

Things that work:
multiple workspaces, and switching between them.
window shading, iconification, settings windows to sticky.
root window clicks (might be some bugs).

Things that don't work:
layers
GNOME window-size hints, and some other hints

These patches should be sufficient to make the gnome-pager applet work with 
ETWM.  However, you'll want to make a few changes to your .etwmrc in order to 
make it work well.  These changes have been made to the default .etwmrc
(system.etwmrc) included in the distribution.  The changes are:
1. Make the panel occupy all workspaces 
2. Remove the borders and title bar from the panel window
3. Don't show the workspace manager and the icon manager
4. Remove the border and title from gmc windows; you might want them to occupy
all workspaces.
5. In order to have root window clicks work, don't bind anything (a menu or
other action) to mouse actions on the root window.
