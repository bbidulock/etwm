    This a list of some problems you can encounter while compiling or
using etwm.


    1 - You have the message when compiling (static libraries) or
	running (dynamic libraries) etwm :

ld.so: Undefined symbol: __XtInherit

Why : You have a Sun and the mit X11R5 Xlib prior to the patch level 9,
      there is an incompatibility between the Sun loader and the mit X11R5
      libs before patch 9.

What to do : Upgrade you libs to at least patch level 9, or use :
	     -u __XtInherit at link time.


    2 - On SGI boxes, many GL applications don't behave very well with etwm.
	If an Xpert having a SGI Xserver can have a look at this, I will be
	very pleased.

What to do : Avoid carefully GL tools.


    3 - Xwd files created on DEC/Alpha may not be loaded correctly by etwm.
	Actually the xwd format is not completely portable. But you can load
	on an Alpha a xwd file created on another system.

    4 - On some systems (SVR4 I think), sometimes etwm exits with no warning
	(sometimes, it write 'Alarm Clock'). It is due to a problem with
	signal handling on these systems. If it happens to you, set
	AnimationSpeed to zero, or much better, you can try to find what
	it the problem and send me a patch.

    5 - There is a bug in the SOUND code, either in etwm or in the rplay lib
	that cause core dump. If you have unexpected core dump and compiled
	with USE_SOUND on, first try to undef it and recompile before
	complaining.
