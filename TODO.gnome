Should we set SKIP_WINLIST, SKIP_TASKBAR, etc. on IconManagerDontShow windows?  Maybe HIDDEN?
Is there a problem with the current approach (don't tell GNOME about those windows at all)?
Layer and size hints
- layers... how does stacking order work?
autoconf (replace Imakefile)
configuration capplet or standalone application
add an option to the gnomepager-applet to move windows to other workspaces
- ideally, one would drag windows, like the workspacemanager.
	however, even a pop-up menu listing workspaces and allowing movement would 
	be an improvement.
Why doesn't the workspace window work for some GTK apps?
- transient problem.  Why are all GTK windows transient?  Is this a WM bug, 
  or a GTK problem?  Investigate.
Cleanup on exit - remove properties from root window.
Write a small utility app using libetwm so that any ETWM will work with GNOME.
